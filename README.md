# Super-Resolution of License Plate Images Using Attention Modules and Sub-Pixel Convolution Layers

*Paper currently under review*
Upon acceptance, we will be releasing all datasets used in our experiments, as well as the source code, in order to encourage further research and development in the field of super-resolution for License Plate Recognition (LPR).
